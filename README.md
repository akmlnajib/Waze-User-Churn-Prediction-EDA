# Waze User Churn Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting user churn for the Waze app. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the data team seeks to gain insights into user behavior, identify patterns, and create visualizations to support business strategies for improving user retention.

## Project Goal
- Clean and preprocess data.
- Handle outliers effectively.
- Perform EDA to uncover trends and insights.
- Visualize data using Tableau for stakeholder communication.
- Share an executive summary with actionable insights.
